# Roullete
A multiplayer game of Russian Roullete built using C.  
The game takes input of number of players and then starts the game by taking the amount each player wishes to bet.
In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number or a range of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even.  
To determine the winning number and color, a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the circumference of the wheel.   
The ball eventually loses momentum and falls on to the wheel and into one of 37 (in French/European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) colored and numbered pockets on the wheel.  
Then if the bet is true then the player gains cash or losses cash.  
For the graphics used in the program ‘’sound’’, ‘’delay’’, ‘’nosound’’,’’ textatrr’’,”cprintf” has been used under the header file ‘’dos.h’,’stdlib.h’,’conio.h’.
